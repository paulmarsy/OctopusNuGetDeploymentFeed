# Octopus Deploy - NuGet Deployment Feed
A NuGet feed for Octopus Deploy which creates NuGet packages used to chain deployments of different Octopus projects together.

# Install
1. Use the **[Octopus - Create Chain Deployment NuGet Feed micro service](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Library/pull/582)** community step template to provision & deploy the NuGet feed micro service. The following parameters do not have a default value and must be provided:
- API Key
- Octopus Azure Account
- Existing Virtual Network Resource Group Name
- Existing Virtual Network Name
- Existing Subnet Name
[Note : This template will not create a Virtual Network/Subnet]

Once deployed all chain functionality is provided by the NuGet feed & the built-in **Deploy a package** step.

2. Add a **Deploy a package** step to the deployment process of an Octopus project with the package id containing the name of the Octopus project you wish to trigger the deployment of.

3. Create a release. The Octopus projects being deployed follow the same behaviour as regular package steps, so the release version being deployed is set when the parent release is made & channel version rules can be used to select stable or development channel releases appropriately.

## Manual Install

**It is recommended to use the step template install described in the previous section, the following steps are only needed if manually deploying the service**Â 

1. Deploy the NuGet feed from this repository, the following ARM template takes less than 10 minutes to run and if deployed onto a virtual network that has two way connectivity with Octopus Deploy is fully functional once the template finishes.

2. Create a new 'External Feed' in Octopus Deploy. The feed should be configured as follows:
  * **Feed Type** NuGet Feed
  * **URL** Address where the feed has been deployed, for example if the VM has the IP 1.2.3.4 enter http://1.2.3.4/nuget/
  * **Username** Base URL of the Octopus Server which the NuGet feed should connect to, for example https://my-octopus-server.com/
  * **Password** A valid Octopus Deploy API key to authenticate with
